# Code Style and Conventions

## TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for type-safety
- Define types in dedicated files or adjacent to components
- Avoid using `any` type

## Component Pattern
- Use functional components and hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Use composition to build complex components

## File Structure
- Group related files in dedicated directories
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Prefix internal/private directories with underscore (`_components`, `_hooks`)
- Keep files under 250 lines when possible

## Styling
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Follow the shadcn component approach
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Maintain consistent spacing and naming conventions

## Imports
- Group imports by type (React, components, utils, types)
- Use absolute imports from the project root
- Avoid circular dependencies
